## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Custom User Model**
- Extended Django's AbstractUser to add `is_creator` and `is_student` fields
- Enables role-based access control and different user experiences
- Supports future expansion of user types

### 2. **Channel-Based Subscriptions**
- Users subscribe to creators (channels), not individual videos
- Mimics YouTube's subscription model for familiar UX
- Enables creator-focused content discovery

### 3. **Dual Dashboard System**
- **Creator Studio**: Content management, analytics, video uploads
- **User Profile**: Personal activity, subscriptions, social features
- Clear separation of concerns based on user intent

### 4. **Interactive Video Previews**
- Hover-to-play functionality for better content discovery
- Reduces cognitive load - users can preview before committing
- Modern UX pattern familiar from major video platforms

### 5. **API-First Approach**
- REST endpoints alongside traditional views
- Enables future mobile app development
- Demonstrates modern web architecture understanding

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/videos/` - List all videos
- `GET /api/videos/{id}/` - Get specific video details

### Authenticated Endpoints
- `GET /api/user/stats/` - Current user statistics

### Example Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 5,
  "videos": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Python Basics Tutorial",
      "creator": "john_doe",
      "views": 150,
      "likes": 12,
      "uploaded_at": "2024-01-15 10:30:00"
    }
  ]
}
```
