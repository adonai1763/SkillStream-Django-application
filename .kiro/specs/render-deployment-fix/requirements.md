# Requirements Document - Render Deployment Fix

## Introduction

The SkillStream Django application is failing to deploy on Render due to Django settings module configuration issues. The deployment logs show `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'`, indicating that Django is trying to import the environment variable name instead of using its value as the settings module path.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Django application to deploy successfully on Render, so that the SkillStream video platform is accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Render THEN Django SHALL successfully load the production settings module
2. WHEN the start.sh script runs THEN the collectstatic command SHALL execute without errors
3. WHEN the start.sh script runs THEN database migrations SHALL execute successfully
4. WHEN Gunicorn starts THEN the WSGI application SHALL load without module import errors
5. WHEN users access the deployed URL THEN the application SHALL respond with the home page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable handling in the Django configuration, so that the application can distinguish between development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is set to "config.settings.production" THEN Django SHALL import the production settings
2. WHEN the production settings are loaded THEN the application SHALL use PostgreSQL if DATABASE_URL is provided
3. WHEN the production settings are loaded THEN the application SHALL fallback to SQLite if no DATABASE_URL is provided
4. WHEN static files are collected THEN WhiteNoise SHALL handle static file serving in production

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment process to be reliable and repeatable, so that future deployments work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured in Render THEN they SHALL be properly exported to the application environment
2. WHEN the Docker container starts THEN all required environment variables SHALL be available
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log successful initialization messages
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the root cause
