# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on deploying the SkillStream Django application to production environments to showcase professional deployment skills for portfolio purposes. The deployment should demonstrate understanding of cloud platforms, production configurations, security best practices, and modern DevOps workflows that employers expect from Django developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Heroku Production Deployment

**User Story:** As a potential employer reviewing this portfolio project, I want to see the application deployed and accessible online, so that I can evaluate the developer's deployment skills and see the project in action without setting it up locally.

1. WHEN accessing the deployed URL THEN the application SHALL load completely with all features functional
2. WHEN users register and login THEN authentication SHALL work properly in production
3. WHEN videos are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored and accessible in production environment
4. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL use HTTPS with proper SSL certificates
5. WHEN checking the deployment THEN it SHALL use PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite
6. WHEN reviewing the setup THEN it SHALL demonstrate proper environment variable management
7. WHEN examining the configuration THEN it SHALL show production-ready Django settings

### Requirement 2: Production-Ready Configuration

**User Story:** As a technical interviewer, I want to see that the developer understands production deployment differences from development, so that I can assess their knowledge of real-world application deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing settings THEN the application SHALL have separate production configuration
2. WHEN checking security THEN all sensitive data SHALL be stored in environment variables
3. WHEN examining the database THEN it SHALL use PostgreSQL with proper connection pooling
4. WHEN reviewing static files THEN they SHALL be served efficiently with WhiteNoise
5. WHEN checking middleware THEN security headers SHALL be properly configured
6. WHEN examining logging THEN production logging SHALL be properly configured
7. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN production requirements SHALL be optimized and pinned

### Requirement 3: Cloud Platform Integration

**User Story:** As a hiring manager, I want to see that the developer can work with modern cloud platforms and services, so that I can evaluate their ability to work in cloud-first environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed on Heroku THEN the application SHALL use Heroku PostgreSQL addon
2. WHEN handling media files THEN they SHALL be stored on cloud storage (AWS S3 or similar)
3. WHEN checking performance THEN the application SHALL use CDN for static file delivery
4. WHEN reviewing monitoring THEN basic application monitoring SHALL be configured
5. WHEN examining scaling THEN the deployment SHALL support horizontal scaling
6. WHEN checking backups THEN database backups SHALL be automated
7. WHEN reviewing logs THEN centralized logging SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 4: DevOps and CI/CD Integration

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to see that the developer understands modern deployment workflows, so that I can assess their readiness for team-based development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN automated deployment SHALL trigger
2. WHEN deployment runs THEN automated tests SHALL pass before deployment
3. WHEN reviewing the setup THEN GitHub Actions SHALL handle CI/CD pipeline
4. WHEN checking deployment THEN database migrations SHALL run automatically
5. WHEN examining the process THEN static files SHALL be collected automatically
6. WHEN reviewing rollback THEN easy rollback mechanism SHALL be available
7. WHEN checking monitoring THEN deployment status SHALL be tracked and reported

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability Configuration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to see that the developer considers performance and scalability in production deployments, so that I can evaluate their understanding of production system requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN under load THEN the application SHALL handle multiple concurrent users
2. WHEN serving media THEN video files SHALL be delivered efficiently
3. WHEN checking database THEN queries SHALL be optimized for production
4. WHEN reviewing caching THEN appropriate caching strategies SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN examining static files THEN they SHALL be compressed and cached properly
6. WHEN checking memory usage THEN the application SHALL use memory efficiently
7. WHEN reviewing scaling THEN the deployment SHALL support auto-scaling

### Requirement 6: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security-conscious employer, I want to see that the developer implements security best practices in production deployments, so that I can assess their understanding of application security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the site THEN all traffic SHALL be encrypted with HTTPS
2. WHEN reviewing headers THEN security headers SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN checking authentication THEN secure session management SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN examining file uploads THEN proper validation and security SHALL be enforced
5. WHEN reviewing database THEN connection security SHALL be properly configured
6. WHEN checking environment THEN debug mode SHALL be disabled in production
7. WHEN examining logs THEN sensitive information SHALL not be logged

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to see that the developer understands production monitoring and maintenance, so that I can evaluate their operational awareness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and monitored
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL detect and alert
3. WHEN checking uptime THEN application availability SHALL be tracked
4. WHEN reviewing metrics THEN key performance indicators SHALL be monitored
5. WHEN examining logs THEN they SHALL be centralized and searchable
6. WHEN checking health THEN health check endpoints SHALL be available
7. WHEN reviewing maintenance THEN automated backup and recovery SHALL be configured

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Portfolio Presentation

**User Story:** As a potential employer, I want to see comprehensive documentation of the deployment process and architecture, so that I can understand the developer's technical communication skills and deployment knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN deployment process SHALL be clearly documented
2. WHEN checking the README THEN live demo link SHALL be prominently displayed
3. WHEN examining architecture THEN production architecture SHALL be diagrammed
4. WHEN reviewing setup THEN environment setup SHALL be documented
5. WHEN checking troubleshooting THEN common issues SHALL be documented
6. WHEN examining the project THEN deployment badges SHALL show build status
7. WHEN reviewing portfolio THEN deployment demonstrates professional-level skills
